# Why did I get a Moonlander?

- 💀 So I don't die of wrist/shoulder pain when I'm old
- 🎨 It looks bad ass 
- ☕ Coffee in the middle for quick access
- ⌨️ Better for vim™
- 🧑‍💻 Good community & software

#### day1 (4/20/23)

This is hard, slow typing like 4wpm. Programming is not possible without looking at the keyboard legend.
