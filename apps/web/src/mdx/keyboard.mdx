# Why do I use an "ergonomic" keyboard? 

- üíÄ So I don't die of wrist/shoulder pain when I'm old
- üé® It looks bad ass and is very comfortable 
- ‚òï Coffee in the middle for quick access
- ‚å®Ô∏è  Better for vim‚Ñ¢ (source: trust me bro)
- üßë‚Äçüíª Great community & software

You can track my [Moonlander layout](https://configure.zsa.io/moonlander/layouts/Qj4BD/latest/0) if you'd like to see what I've changed but for the most part I've kept it pretty stock OEM.

#### day1 (4/20/23)

This is hard, slow typing like 4wpm. Programming is not possible without looking at the keyboard legend.

#### day2 (4/21/23)

Today I was able to hit peak speed of 55wpm without symbols or capitalization [typingclub](https://typingclub.com)

#### day3 (5/03/23)
Took a vacation but was able to float around 50wpm and getting better at coding.

#### day4 (5/04/23)
Right off the rip I got a 61wpm on [typingclub](https://typingclub.com), though programming is still rather challenging but making good progress.

#### day5 (5/06/23)
Spent a few hours programming and I'm getting more effiecent at finding the symbol keys in the left side of the keyboard.
