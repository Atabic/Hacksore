# Windows
These are all the things I use when on my PC but It's mainly used for Gaming.

### Software
- <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com" target="_blank">VSCode</a> is my daily editor and you can see all the extensions I use [here](https://github.com/Hacksore/Hacksore/blob/master/EXTENSIONS.md)
- I mainly use <a href="https://github.com/features/codespaces" target="_blank">Github Codespaces</a> when on windows because developing on windows sucks and WSL is not that good

### Hardware
- CPU - Intel i9 9900k
- GPU - ASUS GTX 1080
- MOBO - ASUS ROG Strix Z390-E
- RAM - CORSAIR Vengeance LPX 32GB
